
# Q: is a matrix-vector multiplication the same as a vector-matrix multiplication?

a: No, matrix-vector multiplication and vector-matrix multiplication are not the same, and the order matters.

1. **Matrix-Vector Multiplication (A * v):**
   - In this case, the matrix \( A \) is of size \( m \times n \) (m rows, n columns), and the vector \( v \) is of size \( n \times 1 \) (a column vector with n elements).
   - The result is a new vector of size \( m \times 1 \).
   - Example: If \( A \) is \( 3 \times 2 \) and \( v \) is \( 2 \times 1 \), then the result will be a \( 3 \times 1 \) vector.

2. **Vector-Matrix Multiplication (v * A):**
   - In this case, the vector \( v \) is typically of size \( 1 \times n \) (a row vector with n elements), and the matrix \( A \) is of size \( n \times m \).
   - The result is a new vector of size \( 1 \times m \).
   - Example: If \( v \) is \( 1 \times 2 \) and \( A \) is \( 2 \times 3 \), then the result will be a \( 1 \times 3 \) vector.

So, the order in which you multiply matters, and generally, matrix-vector multiplication involves a matrix multiplying a vector, while vector-matrix multiplication involves a row vector multiplying a matrix. The dimensions of the resulting vectors are different in each case.

## q: can you generate a vector-matrix multiplication and a matrix-vector multiplication method in python?

a: Sure! Below are Python methods to perform both **vector-matrix multiplication** and **matrix-vector multiplication**.

### 1. **Matrix-Vector Multiplication**
Here, we will assume the matrix `A` is of size \( m \times n \) and the vector `v` is of size \( n \times 1 \).

```python
import numpy as np

def matrix_vector_multiplication(A, v):
    # Perform matrix-vector multiplication
    return np.dot(A, v)
```

### 2. **Vector-Matrix Multiplication**
Here, we will assume the vector `v` is of size \( 1 \times n \) and the matrix `A` is of size \( n \times m \).

```python
def vector_matrix_multiplication(v, A):
    # Perform vector-matrix multiplication
    return np.dot(v, A)
```

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example matrix and vectors
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])  # 3x2 matrix
v = np.array([1, 2])  # 2x1 vector (column)

# Matrix-Vector multiplication (result will be a 3x1 vector)
result_matrix_vector = matrix_vector_multiplication(A, v)
print("Matrix-Vector Result:", result_matrix_vector)

# Vector-Matrix multiplication (result will be a 1x3 vector)
v_row = np.array([1, 2])  # Row vector (1x2)
A_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])  # 2x3 matrix
result_vector_matrix = vector_matrix_multiplication(v_row, A_matrix)
print("Vector-Matrix Result:", result_vector_matrix)
```

### Output:
```python
Matrix-Vector Result: [ 5 11 17]
Vector-Matrix Result: [ 9 12 15]
```

### Notes:
- `np.dot()` is used for matrix multiplication in NumPy, which works for both matrix-vector and vector-matrix multiplications.
- Make sure the dimensions of the inputs match the required sizes for each multiplication to work.

## q: can you generate two separate methods in plain vanilla python (without numpy)?

a: Absolutely! Here are two separate methods for matrix-vector and vector-matrix multiplication in plain Python without relying on NumPy.

### 1. **Matrix-Vector Multiplication**

Here, we will perform matrix-vector multiplication where the matrix `A` is of size \( m \times n \) and the vector `v` is of size \( n \times 1 \). The result will be a vector of size \( m \times 1 \).

```python
def matrix_vector_multiplication(A, v):
    # Check if the matrix and vector dimensions are compatible
    if len(A[0]) != len(v):
        raise ValueError("Number of columns in A must equal number of rows in v")
    
    result = []
    for i in range(len(A)):  # iterate over each row of the matrix
        row_result = 0
        for j in range(len(A[0])):  # iterate over columns of the matrix
            row_result += A[i][j] * v[j]  # sum of products
        result.append(row_result)
    
    return result
```

### 2. **Vector-Matrix Multiplication**

For this method, we'll assume the vector `v` is of size \( 1 \times n \) and the matrix `A` is of size \( n \times m \). The result will be a vector of size \( 1 \times m \).

```python
def vector_matrix_multiplication(v, A):
    # Check if the vector and matrix dimensions are compatible
    if len(v) != len(A):
        raise ValueError("Number of elements in v must equal number of rows in A")
    
    result = []
    for j in range(len(A[0])):  # iterate over each column of the matrix
        col_result = 0
        for i in range(len(v)):  # iterate over the vector and rows of the matrix
            col_result += v[i] * A[i][j]  # sum of products
        result.append(col_result)
    
    return result
```

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example matrix and vectors
A = [[1, 2], 
     [3, 4], 
     [5, 6]]  # 3x2 matrix
v = [1, 
     2]  # 2x1 vector (column)

# Matrix-Vector multiplication (result will be a 3x1 vector)
result_matrix_vector = matrix_vector_multiplication(A, v)
print("Matrix-Vector Result:", result_matrix_vector)

# Vector-Matrix multiplication (result will be a 1x3 vector)
v_row = [1, 2]  # Row vector (1x2)
A_matrix = [[1, 2, 3], 
            [4, 5, 6]]  # 2x3 matrix
result_vector_matrix = vector_matrix_multiplication(v_row, A_matrix)
print("Vector-Matrix Result:", result_vector_matrix)
```

### Output:
```python
Matrix-Vector Result: [5, 11, 17]
Vector-Matrix Result: [9, 12, 15]
```

### Notes:
- **Matrix-Vector Multiplication**: For each row in the matrix `A`, we compute the dot product with the vector `v`.
- **Vector-Matrix Multiplication**: For each column in the matrix `A`, we compute the dot product with the vector `v`.

These methods will work in any Python environment without relying on external libraries. The checks ensure the dimensions match up, and the multiplication logic is implemented manually.
