
# Q: how to use negative sampling in training for word embeddings?

a: Negative sampling is a technique commonly used in training **word embeddings** (such as in models like Word2Vec) to improve computational efficiency and quality. It’s used during the training of models that aim to learn dense vector representations for words (embeddings) based on their context in large corpora.

### How Negative Sampling Works in Word Embeddings:

In **Word2Vec** (specifically, in the **Skip-gram** and **Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)** models), the objective is to predict a word given its context (or vice versa). For this, the model tries to maximize the probability of the target word given its context words (or context given the target).

However, calculating the likelihood for all words in the vocabulary would be computationally expensive, especially when you have a large vocabulary. Negative sampling helps to **approximate** this computation efficiently by only considering a small, **random subset of words** (called negative samples) rather than all possible words.

Here’s how it works in the context of training word embeddings:

### 1. **Positive Sample**:
   - A **positive sample** is a pair consisting of a target word and one of its context words. For example, in the sentence **"The cat sat on the mat"**, if the target word is **"cat"** and the context is **"sat"**, **(cat, sat)** is a positive sample.

### 2. **Negative Samples**:
   - For each positive sample, we generate **negative samples**. Negative samples are randomly chosen words from the vocabulary that do **not** appear in the context of the target word.
   - In the previous example, for the positive sample **(cat, sat)**, you might randomly select negative samples like **(cat, "dog")**, **(cat, "ball")**, or **(cat, "apple")**. These words (like "dog" or "ball") are irrelevant to the context of "cat" in the given sentence.

### 3. **Training with Negative Sampling**:
   - For each positive sample (target word and context word pair), the model is trained to:
     - **Increase the probability** of the target word and context word occurring together.
     - **Decrease the probability** of the target word occurring with randomly selected negative samples (words that are not part of the context).
   - This process helps the model learn to distinguish between words that are likely to appear together in a given context and words that are unlikely to appear together.

### 4. **Mathematics Behind It**:
   The **Skip-gram** model with negative sampling (SGNS) optimizes the following objective:

   \[
   J(\theta) = \sum_{(w_c, w_t) \in D} \log \sigma(v_{w_c}^T v_{w_t}) + \sum_{i=1}^{k} \mathbb{E}_{w_n \sim P(w)} [ \log \sigma(-v_{w_c}^T v_{w_n}) ]
   \]

   - Where:
     - \( v_{w_c} \) and \( v_{w_t} \) are the vector representations (embeddings) of the context word \( w_c \) and target word \( w_t \), respectively.
     - \( \sigma(x) \) is the **sigmoid function**, which outputs values between 0 and 1, representing the probability that a word-pair is related.
     - \( P(w) \) is a probability distribution over words in the vocabulary (often approximated by the word's frequency).
     - \( k \) is the number of negative samples.
     - The first term in the objective function maximizes the probability of positive word pairs (context-target).
     - The second term minimizes the probability of negative pairs (context-random word).

### 5. **Why Negative Sampling?**
   - **Efficiency**: Instead of considering all the words in the vocabulary (which can be huge), negative sampling only focuses on a small number of negative samples per update. This makes it computationally much more efficient.
   - **Quality of Embeddings**: It helps the model focus on learning the relationships between words that are semantically relevant and not get bogged down by the vast majority of irrelevant words.

### 6. **Sampling Strategy**:
   - The negative samples aren’t chosen uniformly at random. Instead, they are usually sampled based on a **distribution** that favors frequent words slightly less (to avoid over-representing common words). One common strategy is to sample negative words according to their **frequency raised to a power** (typically \( 0.75 \)).

### Steps to Use Negative Sampling for Training Word Embeddings:

1. **Select a target word** (center word) from a sentence.
2. **Choose context words** from the surrounding words in a fixed window size around the target word.
3. For each context word, generate a **positive sample** (the target-context pair).
4. Randomly select **negative samples** (random words that are not context words).
5. Update the embeddings by training on both the positive and negative pairs:
   - **Increase the score** for positive samples.
   - **Decrease the score** for negative samples.

### Example:

In the sentence **"The quick brown fox"**, if we choose the target word **"quick"** and the context words are **"the"**, **"brown"**, and **"fox"**, then:

- Positive pairs might be:
  - (quick, the)
  - (quick, brown)
  - (quick, fox)

- For negative sampling, we randomly select, say, 3 words from the vocabulary (words like "apple", "car", "dog" that don't appear near "quick").
  - Negative pairs might be:
    - (quick, apple)
    - (quick, car)
    - (quick, dog)

Then, we update the embeddings to maximize the likelihood of the positive pairs and minimize the likelihood of the negative ones.

### Conclusion:
Negative sampling is a crucial technique for training word embeddings because it significantly reduces the computational cost of learning useful word representations and helps the model distinguish between relevant and irrelevant words. It ensures that the embeddings capture semantic relationships effectively while being efficient enough for large datasets.

## q: can you show an example script in python (with numpy)?

a:  Here's a basic Python example that demonstrates negative sampling for training word embeddings, using **numpy**. This script is simplified for illustration purposes, focusing on how negative sampling would work in a basic setting (using a small vocabulary).

We'll use the **Skip-gram** model with negative sampling and create a toy dataset for this example.

### Basic Python Example: Skip-gram with Negative Sampling

```python
import numpy as np
import random
from collections import Counter

# Example toy corpus
corpus = [
    "the quick brown fox",
    "jumped over the lazy dog",
    "the dog barked loudly",
    "the fox ran fast"
]

# Preprocess the corpus (tokenization and word frequency count)
def preprocess(corpus):
    words = [word for sentence in corpus for word in sentence.split()]
    word_counts = Counter(words)
    vocabulary = list(word_counts.keys())
    return words, vocabulary, word_counts

# Sample a negative word based on word frequencies
def get_negative_sample(vocab, word_counts, num_negatives=1):
    words, freqs = zip(*word_counts.items())
    total_freq = sum(freqs)
    probabilities = [freq / total_freq for freq in freqs]
    
    negative_samples = np.random.choice(words, size=num_negatives, p=probabilities)
    return negative_samples

# Skip-gram model with negative sampling
def skipgram_negative_sampling(words, vocabulary, word_counts, embedding_dim=5, window_size=2, num_negatives=2, learning_rate=0.1, epochs=100):
    # Initialize word embeddings (randomly)
    word_embeddings = {word: np.random.randn(embedding_dim) for word in vocabulary}
    context_embeddings = {word: np.random.randn(embedding_dim) for word in vocabulary}

    for epoch in range(epochs):
        total_loss = 0
        
        # Loop over each word in the corpus
        for i, word in enumerate(words):
            # Define the context window (words surrounding the target word)
            start = max(i - window_size, 0)
            end = min(i + window_size + 1, len(words))
            context_words = [words[j] for j in range(start, end) if j != i]

            for context_word in context_words:
                # Positive sample (context, target pair)
                target_vector = word_embeddings[word]
                context_vector = context_embeddings[context_word]
                
                # Compute the dot product (score) for the positive pair
                score_positive = np.dot(target_vector, context_vector)
                loss_positive = -np.log(sigmoid(score_positive))
                
                # Update the embeddings using gradient descent for positive sample
                grad_positive = sigmoid(score_positive) - 1
                word_embeddings[word] -= learning_rate * grad_positive * context_vector
                context_embeddings[context_word] -= learning_rate * grad_positive * target_vector

                # Negative samples
                negative_samples = get_negative_sample(vocabulary, word_counts, num_negatives)
                
                for negative_word in negative_samples:
                    negative_vector = context_embeddings[negative_word]
                    
                    # Compute the dot product (score) for the negative pair
                    score_negative = np.dot(target_vector, negative_vector)
                    loss_negative = -np.log(sigmoid(-score_negative))
                    
                    # Update the embeddings using gradient descent for negative sample
                    grad_negative = sigmoid(-score_negative) - 1
                    word_embeddings[word] -= learning_rate * grad_negative * negative_vector
                    context_embeddings[negative_word] -= learning_rate * grad_negative * target_vector
                
                # Total loss for this pair (positive + negative samples)
                total_loss += loss_positive + np.sum(loss_negative)
        
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {total_loss}")

    return word_embeddings, context_embeddings

# Sigmoid function
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Preprocess the corpus
words, vocabulary, word_counts = preprocess(corpus)

# Train the embeddings using Skip-gram with negative sampling
word_embeddings, context_embeddings = skipgram_negative_sampling(words, vocabulary, word_counts, embedding_dim=5, window_size=2, num_negatives=2, learning_rate=0.1, epochs=100)

# Print the resulting embeddings for each word
for word in word_embeddings:
    print(f"Word: {word}, Embedding: {word_embeddings[word]}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Corpus Preprocessing**:
   - The corpus is tokenized into words, and a frequency count is made of how often each word appears.

2. **Negative Sampling**:
   - The `get_negative_sample` function randomly selects words from the vocabulary based on their frequencies. The more frequent words are more likely to be chosen as negative samples.

3. **Skip-gram Model**:
   - For each target word, the script takes a context window around it and calculates the loss and gradients for both the positive word-context pair and the negative samples. The embeddings are updated accordingly.

4. **Sigmoid Function**:
   - The `sigmoid` function squashes the dot product between word vectors to a probability value between 0 and 1, which is used to compute the loss.

5. **Training**:
   - The model is trained over multiple epochs, and the embeddings are updated based on the computed gradients for both positive and negative samples.

### Example Output:
This script will print the learned embeddings for each word in the vocabulary after training (though with a small corpus like this, the results won't be very meaningful until trained on a much larger dataset).

### Notes:
- **Efficiency**: This script is quite basic and not optimized for real-world usage (i.e., large corpora or performance), but it shows the core idea of how negative sampling works.
- **Hyperparameters**: You can experiment with the `embedding_dim`, `window_size`, `num_negatives`, `learning_rate`, and `epochs` to see how they affect the embeddings.

## q: can you explain the backprop step-by-step?

a:  You're welcome! I'd be happy to explain the backpropagation process step-by-step for the **Skip-gram model with Negative Sampling** (SGNS). Backpropagation is the key part of training any neural network, where we compute the gradients of the loss with respect to the model parameters (embeddings in this case) and use those gradients to update the parameters.

### Overview:
In **Skip-gram with Negative Sampling**, the goal is to train a model where the embeddings of words in the vocabulary are updated based on how well they predict their surrounding context words. For each target word (the word we're trying to predict), the model uses both **positive samples** (real context words) and **negative samples** (randomly chosen words that are not in the context).

#### Let's break down the backpropagation steps:

### 1. **Model Setup:**
We have two sets of embeddings:
- **Target embeddings** (for the center word `w_c`)
- **Context embeddings** (for the surrounding words `w_t` and `w_n`)

Each word in the vocabulary has two corresponding vectors: one for its **target embedding** and one for its **context embedding**.

- **Input**: A target word `w_c` (center word) and its context words `w_t` (positive context) and `w_n` (negative samples).

The model uses these embeddings to predict the probability of context words given the target word.

### 2. **Forward Pass:**
We start by performing a **forward pass** to compute the predicted probabilities. This is done in two parts:
- **Positive pair**: The probability of seeing a context word `w_t` given the target word `w_c`.
- **Negative pairs**: The probability of seeing a negative sample `w_n` given the target word `w_c`.

For the positive sample `(w_c, w_t)`:
- Compute the **dot product** between the target word embedding \( v_{w_c} \) and the context word embedding \( v_{w_t} \).
- Apply the **sigmoid function** to get a probability between 0 and 1:
  \[
  p_{\text{positive}} = \sigma(v_{w_c}^T v_{w_t}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(v_{w_c}^T v_{w_t})}}
  \]
  This represents how likely the context word is given the target word.

For the negative sample `(w_c, w_n)` (similar to the positive sample):
- Compute the **dot product** between the target word embedding \( v_{w_c} \) and the context word embedding \( v_{w_n} \).
- Apply the **sigmoid** function:
  \[
  p_{\text{negative}} = \sigma(-v_{w_c}^T v_{w_n}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{v_{w_c}^T v_{w_n}}}
  \]
  The negative sign ensures that we penalize the model for assigning a high probability to incorrect word pairs.

### 3. **Loss Calculation (Objective Function):**
The total loss is the sum of:
- The **log-likelihood** for the positive pair.
- The **log-likelihood** for the negative samples (we multiply the negative log likelihood by how many negative samples we use).

For the positive sample:
\[
L_{\text{positive}} = -\log(p_{\text{positive}})
\]

For the negative samples (assuming `k` negative samples):
\[
L_{\text{negative}} = -\sum_{i=1}^{k} \log(p_{\text{negative}, i})
\]

The total loss is:
\[
L_{\text{total}} = L_{\text{positive}} + L_{\text{negative}}
\]

### 4. **Backpropagation (Gradient Computation):**
Now we perform the **backpropagation** to compute the gradients of the loss with respect to the word embeddings (both target and context).

#### Gradient w.r.t. Target Embedding \( v_{w_c} \):

For the **positive sample** (target word `w_c` and context word `w_t`), the gradient of the loss with respect to the target embedding \( v_{w_c} \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial L_{\text{positive}}}{\partial v_{w_c}} = (p_{\text{positive}} - 1) \cdot v_{w_t}
\]

- The term \( p_{\text{positive}} - 1 \) is the derivative of the loss with respect to the probability (the error term).
- We then multiply this error term by the context embedding \( v_{w_t} \) to propagate the error to the target embedding.

For each **negative sample** `(w_c, w_n)`, the gradient of the loss with respect to the target embedding \( v_{w_c} \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial L_{\text{negative}}}{\partial v_{w_c}} = (p_{\text{negative}} - 1) \cdot (-v_{w_n})
\]

- The term \( p_{\text{negative}} - 1 \) is again the error term for negative samples, and we multiply by the context embedding of the negative sample, \( v_{w_n} \).

The total gradient for the target embedding \( v_{w_c} \) is the sum of the gradients from the positive sample and all negative samples:
\[
\frac{\partial L}{\partial v_{w_c}} = (p_{\text{positive}} - 1) \cdot v_{w_t} + \sum_{i=1}^{k} (p_{\text{negative}, i} - 1) \cdot (-v_{w_n, i})
\]

#### Gradient w.r.t. Context Embedding \( v_{w_t} \) (Positive Sample):
For the **positive sample**, the gradient with respect to the context embedding \( v_{w_t} \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial L_{\text{positive}}}{\partial v_{w_t}} = (p_{\text{positive}} - 1) \cdot v_{w_c}
\]
- Here, we propagate the error from the positive sample through the target embedding.

#### Gradient w.r.t. Context Embedding \( v_{w_n} \) (Negative Samples):
For each **negative sample** `(w_c, w_n)`, the gradient with respect to the context embedding \( v_{w_n} \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial L_{\text{negative}}}{\partial v_{w_n}} = (p_{\text{negative}} - 1) \cdot (-v_{w_c})
\]
- Here, we propagate the error from the negative sample through the target embedding, just like in the target gradient computation.

### 5. **Parameter Update (Gradient Descent):**
Finally, the gradients computed above are used to update the embeddings via **gradient descent**:

For the target embeddings:
\[
v_{w_c} \leftarrow v_{w_c} - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial v_{w_c}}
\]
where \( \eta \) is the learning rate.

For the context embeddings:
\[
v_{w_t} \leftarrow v_{w_t} - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial v_{w_t}}
\]
and similarly for each negative sample:
\[
v_{w_n} \leftarrow v_{w_n} - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial v_{w_n}}
\]

### 6. **Iterate Over All Pairs:**
This process is repeated for each pair of words in the corpus. The embeddings are updated after each iteration based on the positive and negative samples.

### Summary of Steps:
1. **Forward pass**: Compute the probability for positive and negative word pairs using the embeddings and the sigmoid function.
2. **Loss calculation**: Compute the loss using the log-likelihood for positive and negative pairs.
3. **Backpropagation**: Compute the gradients of the loss with respect to the embeddings.
4. **Parameter update**: Use gradient descent to update the embeddings based on the computed gradients.

By repeating this process for many epochs, the embeddings gradually converge to represent words in a high-dimensional vector space, where words with similar meanings or contexts will have similar embeddings.

Let me know if anything is unclear or if you'd like further elaboration on any of the steps!

## q:  are the embedding weights of context and target connected layers or separate?

a:  You're welcome! To clarify your question, in the **Skip-gram model with negative sampling**, the **target embeddings** and **context embeddings** are **separate** and are typically stored in different weight matrices. 

### Explanation:

In the Skip-gram model, there are two sets of embeddings:

1. **Target Embeddings**: These are the embeddings corresponding to the **center word** (target word). When we process a word as the target word in the skip-gram model, we look up its embedding from this set.
   
2. **Context Embeddings**: These are the embeddings corresponding to the **context words** surrounding the target word. When we process a context word (which is the word surrounding the target word in the training data), we look up its embedding from this set.

### Why Are They Separate?

1. **Different Purpose**:
   - The target embeddings represent the "features" of each word when it's in the center position in a given context.
   - The context embeddings represent the "features" of words when they are in the surrounding positions in a given context.
   
   In simpler terms, **target embeddings** capture the meaning of words when they are central to the prediction, while **context embeddings** capture the meaning of words in the context of surrounding words.

2. **Different Learning**:
   - During training, the target and context embeddings are learned through different gradients. The **target embeddings** are updated based on the context words, and the **context embeddings** are updated based on the target word. This learning process is done via **separate gradient updates**, which is why they are typically kept separate.

3. **Matrix Structure**:
   - The target and context embeddings are typically stored in **two separate matrices**:
     - **Target matrix (W)**: A matrix of shape \( V \times D \), where \( V \) is the size of the vocabulary and \( D \) is the embedding dimension. Each row in this matrix represents the embedding of a word in the target (center) word role.
     - **Context matrix (C)**: A matrix of shape \( V \times D \), where each row represents the embedding of a word when it appears in the context of other words.

### To Summarize:

- The **target embeddings** and **context embeddings** are separate in the model. 
- Both are learned through backpropagation, but their gradients are calculated and applied separately.
- In the code, you'll see that these embeddings are stored in different dictionaries or matrices (`word_embeddings` and `context_embeddings` in our example), and they're updated independently.

### Are the Layers "Connected"?

While the target and context embeddings are stored separately, they are conceptually "connected" in the sense that they interact during the training process:

- The **target word embedding** is used to compute the prediction (probability) of the **context words**.
- The **context word embedding** is used to compute the probability of a target word.
  
However, they are not literally connected like layers in a typical deep neural network, where there might be weights that connect one layer to another. Instead, they are learned independently, and the training process ensures that their values complement each other in a way that captures the relationships between words.

### In Real Code:

Here’s a brief reminder of how this structure is usually represented in code:

```python
# Initialize target embeddings and context embeddings separately
word_embeddings = {word: np.random.randn(embedding_dim) for word in vocabulary}
context_embeddings = {word: np.random.randn(embedding_dim) for word in vocabulary}
```

Both sets are learned separately but interact during training via the forward and backward passes.
