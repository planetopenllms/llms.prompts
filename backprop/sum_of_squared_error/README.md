
# Q: what about using the sum of squared errors (SSE) for the loss?

a: Let's talk about **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)** and how it relates to loss functions.

### What is Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)?

**Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)** is simply the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values (\( \hat{y}_i \)) and the true values (\( y_i \)) for all data points in the dataset. It's another way of measuring how well a model's predictions align with the true values.

The formula for SSE is:

\[
SSE = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
\]

Where:
- \( n \) is the number of data points,
- \( y_i \) is the true value (target),
- \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted value.

### SSE vs. MSE:
- **MSE** (Mean Squared Error) is the **average** of the squared errors, where:
  
  \[
  MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
  \]
  MSE is often preferred because it normalizes the error by the number of data points, making it easier to compare across datasets of different sizes.

- **SSE** (Sum of Squared Errors), on the other hand, is simply the **sum** of the squared errors, without averaging by the number of data points.

### Key Differences:
- **Magnitude**: SSE tends to grow larger as the number of data points increases, while MSE remains relatively stable because it is normalized by the total number of data points.
- **Usage**: SSE is often used in situations where you care about the **total error** (e.g., in statistical modeling), but **MSE** is more commonly used for optimization in machine learning because of its stability and consistency across different dataset sizes.

### Can We Use SSE as a Loss Function?
Yes, you can use **SSE** as a loss function, but it has the following implications:
1. **No Normalization**: Since you're not dividing by the number of data points, the magnitude of the loss will scale with the dataset size. This can make it harder to compare performance across different dataset sizes, and it can also cause instability during optimization if you're working with large datasets.

2. **Gradient Computation**: The gradients of SSE with respect to the model parameters (weights and biases) are quite similar to the gradients for MSE. The difference is that you don't have the \( \frac{1}{n} \) term in the gradient computation for SSE. This means that the updates will be larger in magnitude compared to MSE, which can affect convergence and stability in gradient-based optimization.

For example, for a simple linear regression model with weights \( w \), the gradient of SSE with respect to \( w \) is:

\[
\frac{\partial \text{SSE}}{\partial w} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} -2x_i (y_i - \hat{y}_i)
\]

Where:
- \( x_i \) is the input feature for the \( i \)-th data point,
- \( y_i \) is the true value for the \( i \)-th data point,
- \( \hat{y}_i = w x_i + b \) is the predicted value.

If you compared this to the gradient of MSE, the only difference is that the MSE gradient has an additional \( \frac{1}{n} \) term.

### Why Would You Use SSE Instead of MSE?

1. **Total Error**: If you care about the **total error** accumulated over the entire dataset (rather than an average error per data point), you might prefer SSE.
   
2. **Minimizing Over Large Datasets**: If you have very large datasets and want to avoid averaging the error, SSE might be an option. However, this is less common in practice because large datasets can lead to excessively large gradients that can destabilize training.

3. **Computational Simplicity**: SSE doesn't involve averaging over the dataset, so it can sometimes be simpler to compute (though this advantage is often overshadowed by the benefits of MSE).

### What Does SSE Look Like in Mini-batch Gradient Descent?

Just like MSE, you can use SSE in mini-batch gradient descent. In mini-batch gradient descent, the update rule with SSE would look like this:

\[
\theta = \theta - \alpha \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{\text{batch\_size}} \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\hat{y}_i, y_i)
\]

Where \( \mathcal{L} \) is now the SSE, and you are **summing** the squared errors over the mini-batch.

Since SSE doesnâ€™t include the \( \frac{1}{\text{batch\_size}} \) factor, this would make your gradients larger (similar to what we discussed in the case of full-batch gradient descent without the \( \frac{1}{n} \) term). You'd likely need to adjust your learning rate to account for the larger gradient updates.

### In Summary:
- **Yes**, you can use **SSE** as a loss function, but it comes with the trade-off that the magnitude of the loss (and gradients) will grow with the dataset size, making it harder to compare across different datasets.
- **MSE** is more commonly used in machine learning because it **normalizes** the error by the number of data points, ensuring stability in training.
- **SSE** is more appropriate when you're interested in the **total error** across the dataset or when the dataset size is fixed and doesn't affect the magnitude of your gradient updates.

In most machine learning tasks, **MSE** is preferred because it helps to avoid issues with large gradients and allows easier comparison across datasets of different sizes.
