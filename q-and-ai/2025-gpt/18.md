# q: what are the different ways to use and fine-tune pretrained large language models?

Hey! Great question ‚Äî diving into deep learning and LLMs is always exciting. When it comes to using and fine-tuning pretrained large language models (LLMs), there are several strategies depending on your goals, data availability, compute budget, and how much you want to adapt the model. Here's a breakdown of the most common approaches:

---

## üß† **Ways to Use Pretrained LLMs**

### 1. **Zero-shot Learning**
- **What:** You use the model as-is, without any fine-tuning.
- **How:** Just prompt the model with your task directly.
- **When:** Good for general tasks or when you don‚Äôt have labeled data.
- **Example:** "Translate this sentence into French: 'I love pizza.'"

### 2. **Few-shot Learning**
- **What:** Provide a few examples in the prompt itself.
- **How:** Your prompt contains a pattern like:
  ```
  Translate:
  English: I love cats.
  French: J'aime les chats.
  English: I love dogs.
  French:
  ```
- **When:** You want better results than zero-shot, but still no actual training.

### 3. **Prompt Engineering / Prompt Tuning**
- **What:** Design optimal prompts manually or via automated search/tuning.
- **Variants:** 
  - **Manual prompts**
  - **Soft prompt tuning:** Learn embeddings that are prepended to input tokens.
- **When:** You want lightweight adaptation without full retraining.

## üîß **Ways to Fine-tune LLMs**

### 1. **Full Fine-tuning**
- **What:** You train all model parameters on your new dataset.
- **Pros:** Maximum control and adaptability.
- **Cons:** Expensive and requires lots of data/compute.
- **When:** You have a specific domain and large dataset (e.g., legal, medical).

### 2. **Adapter-based Fine-tuning**
- **What:** Insert small "adapter" modules in the model layers and train only those.
- **Popular frameworks:** [AdapterHub](https://adapterhub.ml)
- **Pros:** Efficient, modular, reusable across tasks.
- **Cons:** Slightly less performant than full fine-tuning in some cases.

### 3. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**
- **What:** Train low-rank matrices added to weights; rest of the model is frozen.
- **Used by:** Models like Alpaca, LLaMA variants.
- **Pros:** Very efficient and memory-light.
- **When:** You want a scalable and effective method on modest hardware.

### 4. **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)**
- **Umbrella term** that includes LoRA, adapters, prefix tuning, etc.

### 5. **Instruction Tuning**
- **What:** Fine-tune on a dataset where tasks are presented via instructions (e.g., "Summarize this text").
- **Models:** FLAN-T5, Alpaca, etc.
- **Goal:** Make the model follow arbitrary instructions better.

### 6. **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**
- **What:** Fine-tune models to align with human preferences.
- **How:** First supervised fine-tuning, then reward model, then policy tuning with PPO.
- **Used in:** ChatGPT, Claude, etc.
- **Advanced:** Needs a reward model and lots of human input.

## üß™ Bonus: Evaluation & Deployment

- Evaluate on task-specific metrics (BLEU, F1, etc.).
- Consider quantization/pruning/distillation for deployment.
- Use Hugging Face, OpenAI, or other APIs/frameworks for scaling.

## q: when does it make more sense to use in-context learning rather than fine-tuning, and vice versa?

You're welcome! That‚Äôs a key decision in LLM workflows ‚Äî whether to go with **in-context learning** (like prompt engineering or few-shot prompting) or do **fine-tuning**. Here's a breakdown of when each makes more sense:

---

## ü§ñ **Use In-Context Learning When...**

### ‚úÖ **You don‚Äôt have much labeled data**
- A few examples in the prompt might be enough.
- Perfect for prototyping or quick iterations.

### ‚úÖ **You want to avoid the cost of training**
- No model training = no GPUs, no long wait times.
- Great for cost-conscious setups.

### ‚úÖ **You‚Äôre solving general-purpose tasks**
- LLMs already do well on broad tasks (e.g., summarization, QA).
- Models like GPT-4 or Claude can often do this impressively out of the box.

### ‚úÖ **You need quick adaptability**
- You can change prompts dynamically.
- E.g., adjust tone, style, or task format just by changing the input prompt.

### ‚úÖ **You‚Äôre working with proprietary APIs**
- If you‚Äôre using GPT-4, Claude, or Gemini, you usually can‚Äôt fine-tune directly.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Use Fine-Tuning When...**

### ‚úÖ **Your task is very domain-specific**
- Examples:
  - Legal clause extraction
  - Genomic data classification
  - Niche customer support chatbots

### ‚úÖ **You have a lot of labeled data**
- Enough data to justify training a new model head or adapting weights.
- More data = better fine-tuning results.

### ‚úÖ **You need consistent outputs or custom formats**
- LLMs can hallucinate or vary outputs in in-context learning.
- Fine-tuned models can be more stable, predictable, and structured.

### ‚úÖ **You want to compress prompts (or speed up inference)**
- In-context learning can get expensive (long prompts = slow + costly).
- Fine-tuned models don‚Äôt need repeated examples at inference time.

### ‚úÖ **You‚Äôre deploying offline or on edge devices**
- Fine-tuned models can be smaller and optimized (quantized, pruned, etc.).
- In-context needs longer inputs, which is less efficient.

## q: in prefix tuning, adapters, and LoRA, how can we ensure that the model preserves (and does not forget) the original knowledge?

You're asking the good stuff now ‚Äî this gets to the heart of **parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)** methods. The great news is: preserving the **original model‚Äôs knowledge** is actually a core **design goal** of these methods.

Let‚Äôs break down how **prefix tuning**, **adapters**, and **LoRA** help *retain* pretrained knowledge ‚Äî and what *extra steps* you can take to make that even more robust.

---

## üß© How These Methods Help Prevent Forgetting

### üîπ **Prefix Tuning**
- **How it works:** Adds *learnable "prefix vectors"* to the attention keys and values. These prefixes guide attention without modifying the original model weights.
- **Why it helps:** Since the model weights are frozen, the base knowledge stays intact. You're just nudging the model's focus via soft tokens.

### üîπ **Adapters**
- **How it works:** Tiny networks (usually bottleneck MLPs) inserted between transformer layers. Only the adapter weights are trained.
- **Why it helps:** Main model is untouched. The adapter learns *residual* adjustments while leaving the core representation machinery alone.

### üîπ **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**
- **How it works:** Injects low-rank matrices into linear layers. Base weights are frozen; LoRA learns additive deltas.
- **Why it helps:** Original weight matrices stay frozen. The delta is low-rank, meaning small, targeted changes ‚Äî less chance of overwriting general knowledge.

---

## üß™ Techniques to Further *Ensure* Knowledge Preservation

Even though these methods are already designed to protect base knowledge, here are extra ways to make sure that happens:

### ‚úÖ **Freeze the Base Model**
- This is standard, but worth emphasizing: **don't train the base model weights**.
- Some workflows allow partial unfreezing ‚Äî avoid unless you're confident in the domain shift.

### ‚úÖ **Regularization (e.g., KL Divergence or L2)**
- Penalize changes that diverge too much from the base model's predictions.
- Example: add a loss term to minimize the difference between the original model‚Äôs logits and the fine-tuned model‚Äôs outputs on general data.

### ‚úÖ **Multi-task or Continual Learning**
- Mix in some general tasks (e.g., QA, summarization) during training.
- This keeps the model ‚Äúreminded‚Äù of its broader capabilities.

### ‚úÖ **Evaluation on General Benchmarks**
- After fine-tuning, test on general datasets like SuperGLUE, MMLU, or natural prompts.
- If performance drops hard, you‚Äôve likely caused some forgetting.

### ‚úÖ **Use Adapter Fusion (if applicable)**
- Train multiple adapters for different tasks, and fuse them at runtime.
- Preserves task-specific knowledge in silos, avoiding catastrophic overwrites.
