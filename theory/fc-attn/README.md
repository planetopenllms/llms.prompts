# Q: what is the conceptual difference between model weights in (classic) fully connected layers and attention scores in transformers?

A: The conceptual difference between **model weights** in classic fully connected layers and **attention scores** in Transformers primarily revolves around the way these parameters are used to model relationships between the input elements.

### 1. **Model Weights in Fully Connected Layers** (Classic Neural Networks)
In traditional fully connected (dense) layers, the **model weights** are learned parameters that are used to map inputs to outputs. Here's how it works:
- A fully connected layer is a matrix multiplication between the input and a weight matrix, followed by a bias term and a non-linear activation function.
- The **weights** represent the strength of the connection between each pair of input and output neurons. These weights are **static for each pair** once learned during training and are shared across all examples in the dataset.

**Key Concept**: The weights in fully connected layers capture **direct, fixed relationships** between every pair of input and output units. There is no distinction in how the weights relate to different parts of the input depending on context.

### 2. **Attention Scores in Transformers**
In contrast, **attention scores** in Transformer models (like in self-attention) are used to compute how much focus each token should place on every other token in a sequence. Here's the process:
- In self-attention, each input token is transformed into three vectors: **Query (Q)**, **Key (K)**, and **Value (V)** vectors.
- The **attention score** is computed as the dot product between the **Query** of one token and the **Key** of every other token, usually scaled and passed through a softmax function to normalize the scores into a probability distribution. These scores determine how much influence each token will have on the representation of the other tokens.

**Key Concept**: The attention scores are dynamic and context-dependent. They change depending on the input sequence and the relationships between tokens in that particular sequence. Unlike the fixed weights in fully connected layers, attention scores are learned in relation to the input context and are specific to each position in the sequence.

### Conceptual Differences
- **Static vs. Dynamic**: Model weights in fully connected layers are **static** and **fixed** for all inputs, representing general learned connections between layers. In contrast, attention scores are **dynamic**, changing for each input sequence based on the relationship between tokens.
- **Fixed vs. Contextual Relationships**: Weights in fully connected layers represent **global relationships** between units in the layer, independent of specific input. Attention scores, however, represent **local, context-sensitive relationships** between tokens in the input sequence, varying depending on the tokens' content and position in the sequence.
- **Learned vs. Derived**: In fully connected layers, weights are directly learned through backpropagation during training. In Transformers, the attention scores are derived from the **Query** and **Key** vectors, and are used to weight the **Value** vectors to form the output. The attention mechanism provides a way of computing these scores dynamically based on the input itself.

### Summary:
- **Fully connected layers**: Learn fixed weights that represent relationships between all input-output pairs in the layer.
- **Attention mechanism**: Computes dynamic attention scores for each token based on its relationship with other tokens in the sequence, allowing for context-dependent focus during processing.

This fundamental difference is what enables Transformers to capture complex, contextual relationships in sequential data, while fully connected layers focus on more static, global representations.
