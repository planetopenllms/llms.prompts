# Q: what are the options to linearize the attention weight calculation?

A: You're welcome! In the context of transformers, **linearizing the attention mechanism** is an active area of research aimed at making attention computation more efficient. The typical self-attention mechanism in transformers, especially in models like GPT-2, has a computational complexity of \( O(n^2) \), where \( n \) is the sequence length. This quadratic scaling comes from the pairwise interactions between all tokens in the sequence when calculating the attention weights. Linearizing the attention calculation aims to reduce this complexity to \( O(n) \) or at least make it more manageable for longer sequences.

### Methods to Linearize Attention Weight Calculation:

1. **Linformer** (Linear Transformer):
   - **Approach**: The Linformer proposes that instead of using a full attention matrix to compute the attention scores between all pairs of tokens (which is computationally expensive), we can use **low-rank approximations** of the attention matrix.
   - **Key Idea**: It assumes that the attention matrix can be approximated by a **low-rank matrix**, where the attention weights are computed in a reduced space (using learned projection matrices), leading to a more efficient calculation.
   - **Computational Complexity**: The complexity is reduced from \( O(n^2) \) to \( O(n \cdot k) \), where \( k \) is the rank of the approximation (typically much smaller than \( n \)).
   - **How It Works**: Linformer reduces the attention matrix size by applying **kernelized attention** in the query-key space, where it learns projections of the keys and queries that result in lower-dimensional representations, preserving the relevant information for attention scoring.

2. **Performer** (Efficient Attention):
   - **Approach**: The Performer introduces a method called **favorable functional approximation** for attention, specifically using **kernel-based approximations**.
   - **Key Idea**: Instead of directly calculating attention weights with the softmax function, Performer approximates the attention mechanism using a **positive orthogonal random feature** (a specific kind of kernel). This approximation allows the attention matrix to be computed more efficiently.
   - **Computational Complexity**: Performer achieves a linear time complexity of \( O(n) \) for computing attention with respect to sequence length, making it much more scalable to long sequences.
   - **How It Works**: It replaces the softmax attention mechanism with a kernelized function that approximates the dot product between queries and keys. This kernel approximation allows Performer to avoid the expensive \( O(n^2) \) computation for the full attention matrix.

3. **Longformer**:
   - **Approach**: The Longformer modifies the self-attention mechanism to use a **sliding window** approach for local attention, combined with a **global attention mechanism** for certain tokens.
   - **Key Idea**: Instead of attending to all tokens in the sequence, Longformer uses **local attention windows** where each token only attends to a fixed-size window of neighboring tokens, reducing the number of interactions.
   - **Computational Complexity**: The complexity is reduced from \( O(n^2) \) to \( O(n \cdot w) \), where \( w \) is the size of the attention window.
   - **How It Works**: In Longformer, each token attends to only a small set of nearby tokens (local context), and a few selected tokens may attend globally to the entire sequence (global context). This drastically reduces the number of attention interactions while preserving much of the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies.

4. **Reformer**:
   - **Approach**: Reformer uses **locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)** to approximate the attention mechanism by grouping similar keys and only attending to those that are likely to be relevant, rather than attending to all tokens in the sequence.
   - **Key Idea**: It reduces the complexity by grouping tokens based on similar features and attending only within those groups, thus approximating the full attention mechanism with fewer computations.
   - **Computational Complexity**: The complexity is reduced to \( O(n \log n) \) using LSH.
   - **How It Works**: LSH is used to find similar tokens efficiently, grouping them into hash buckets. Attention is computed only within these hash buckets, reducing the need to calculate the full attention matrix across all tokens.

5. **Linformer** (with Kernelized Attention):
   - **Approach**: This is a hybrid of the kernel-based approximation and low-rank factorization ideas. It uses **kernelized attention** that approximates the attention matrix using simpler, linear functions.
   - **Key Idea**: Like Linformer, it reduces the rank of the attention matrix, but with the added advantage of **approximating the kernel function** to achieve linear complexity in sequence length.
   - **Computational Complexity**: The complexity is reduced to \( O(n \cdot k) \), where \( k \) is the reduced rank.

6. **Sparse Attention Mechanisms**:
   - **Approach**: Instead of attending to all tokens, sparse attention mechanisms restrict the attention to a subset of tokens, often based on some **predefined pattern** or learned sparsity.
   - **Key Idea**: The attention matrix is sparsified so that only a subset of the attention weights are computed, reducing the overall computational cost.
   - **How It Works**: This can be done by using techniques like fixed **local windows**, **strided patterns**, or even **learned sparsity** where the model decides which tokens to attend to based on the context. The **sparsemax** activation function is sometimes used to impose sparsity in the attention distribution.

7. **Attention with Linear Memory**:
   - **Approach**: The idea here is to store previous attention computations and reuse them, thereby **linearizing** the attention across time steps.
   - **Key Idea**: This approach is often used in models like **Universal Transformers**, where memory from past time steps is used to reduce the need for recalculating attention across the entire sequence for each new input token.
   - **How It Works**: It stores the activations or attention patterns from earlier timesteps and reuses them to compute future attention, effectively reducing the number of redundant computations.

### Summary of Options for Linearizing Attention:
1. **Linformer**: Low-rank approximation of the attention matrix, reducing complexity to \( O(n \cdot k) \).
2. **Performer**: Kernel-based approximation, leading to linear time complexity \( O(n) \).
3. **Longformer**: Sliding window attention combined with global attention, reducing complexity to \( O(n \cdot w) \).
4. **Reformer**: Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) for attention, reducing complexity to \( O(n \log n) \).
5. **Sparse Attention**: Sparse attention patterns, reducing the number of attention calculations.
6. **Linear Memory**: Reusing past attention computations to reduce redundancy in attention calculations.

These methods aim to make transformers more efficient and scalable, particularly for long sequences where traditional self-attention would be too computationally expensive.
