**Note:**  The "Trappist" designation is a protected term.  A beer can only be called a "Trappist" if it meets the International Trappist Association's criteria:
* The beer must be brewed within the walls of a Trappist monastery.
* The beer must be brewed by or under the direct supervision of monks.
* The main purpose of brewing must be to support the monastic community and its work.
* The profits from the sale of the beer must be used for the monastery's needs and the work of its members.
* The beer must be commercially available, in bottles or kegs, not as a "homebrew" product.

This list includes only the beers that meet these criteria. There are other beers that are sometimes called "Trappist-style" or "Trappist-inspired," but they don't officially meet the requirements.
