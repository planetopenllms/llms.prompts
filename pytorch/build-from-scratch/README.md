
# Q:  are there any mini pytorch-like build from scratch sources out there?

a: Yes, there are several **"from scratch"** implementations of PyTorch-like frameworks available, which can help you understand the mechanics of neural networks, autograd, and deep learning without relying on high-level frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow. These projects typically involve building the essential components of a neural network framework (e.g., tensors, autograd, optimizers, layers, etc.) from the ground up.

Here are a few great resources for learning and implementing PyTorch-like systems from scratch:



### 1. **"MiniPyTorch" (a minimalistic PyTorch)**

This is a **from scratch** implementation of many key features of PyTorch. The goal of this project is to provide a simplified version of PyTorch's core functionality, such as tensor operations, autograd, and backpropagation.

- **Key Features**:
  - Tensors with automatic differentiation (autograd).
  - Simple implementation of forward and backward passes.
  - Basic neural network layers and optimizers.

- **GitHub Repository**:  
  MiniPyTorch - GitHub @ <https://github.com/karpathy/minipytorch>
  
  **Why it's great**:
  - Developed by **Andrej Karpathy**, this is an excellent resource for learning how neural networks work under the hood.
  - It’s small and simple enough to understand and extend, yet it has enough features to build a neural network.
  
- **Example of basic code**:
  ```python
  class Tensor:
      def __init__(self, data, requires_grad=False):
          self.data = data
          self.requires_grad = requires_grad
          self.grad = None
          self._grad_fn = None

      def backward(self, grad=None):
          if grad is None:
              grad = np.ones_like(self.data)
          self.grad = grad
          if self._grad_fn:
              self._grad_fn.backward(grad)

      def __add__(self, other):
          return Tensor(self.data + other.data, requires_grad=self.requires_grad)

      # Other tensor operations like __mul__, __matmul__, etc. can be implemented similarly.
  ```

### 3. **"Micrograd" by Andrej Karpathy**

Andrej Karpathy, well-known for his contributions to deep learning, created a **minimalistic autograd** system, called **micrograd**, to demonstrate the core idea of autograd without relying on any deep learning framework.

- **Repository**: micrograd - GitHub @ <https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd>
- **Focus**: 
  - This project implements the basics of automatic differentiation from scratch.
  - It’s extremely small (about 200 lines of Python code) and focuses on building a basic autograd engine with backpropagation.
  
- **Why it's great**:
  - It provides a minimalistic and elegant implementation of the **autograd** system, which powers most modern deep learning frameworks.
  - The code is clear and well-commented, perfect for learning how backpropagation and gradient computation work.
  
- **Example Code**:
  ```python
  class Value:
      def __init__(self, data, _children=(), _op='', label=''):
          self.data = data
          self._prev = set(_children)
          self._op = _op
          self._backward = lambda: None
          self.label = label
          self.grad = 0.0

      def __repr__(self):
          return f"Value(data={self.data})"

      def backward(self):
          # Compute the gradients by recursively calling backward() on the parent nodes
          for child in self._prev:
              child._backward()

      # Operations like __add__, __mul__ for tensor-like computations would go here
  ```
